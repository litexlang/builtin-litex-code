# Builtin Litex Code

There are many small facts and concepts in mathematics that can conveniently assist our reasoning. We need to write these mathematical elements in Litex code so that they are automatically executed once the kernel starts.

`main.lix` contains Litex representations of commonly used mathematical concepts and properties. The contents here will be automatically executed when the Litex kernel starts, serving as some commonly used defaults provided to the user.

If there are mathematical elements youâ€™d like Litex to include by default, please open an issue or submit the code yourself. Thank you!
